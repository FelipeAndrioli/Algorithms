## Jar Challenge Algorithm

This challenge was proposed by a professor in university to be done 
with pen and paper. I've decided to go beyond and implement it in C
to test my skills.

The challenge is, you have 2 jars, the first one with the capacity of
4l, the second one with the capacity of 3l. The goal is, put 2l of 
something inside the jar of 4l. 

There are some limitation in this challenge:

	- Both jars only can be fully in his entire capacity
	
	- The jars content can be switched between the two jars, the 
	  exceeded content will be discarted

	- The jars can be emptied, but, all content and not only
	  part of it
